Reliable connection-oriented service has two relatively minor variants: mes- sage sequences and byte streams. In the former, the message boundaries are pre- served. When two 1-KB messages are sent, they arrive as two distinct 1-KB mes- sages, never as one 2-KB message. In the latter, the connection is simply a stream of bytes, with no message boundaries. When 2K bytes arrive at the receiver, there is no way to tell if they were sent as one 2-KB message, two 1-KB messages, 2048 1-byte messages, or something else. If the pages of a book are sent over a network to an imagesetter as separate messages, it might be important to preserve the mes- sage boundaries. On the other hand, with a terminal logging into a remote server system, a byte stream from the terminal to the computer is all that is needed. There are no message boundaries here.
For some applications, the delays introduced by acknowledgements are unac- ceptable. One such application is digitized voice traffic. It is preferable for tele- phone users to hear a bit of noise on the line or a garbled word from time to time than to introduce a delay to wait for acknowledgements.
Not all applications require connections. For example, to test the network, all that is needed is a way to send a single packet that has a high probability of arrival, but no guarantee. Unreliable (meaning not acknowledged) connectionless service is often called datagram service, in analogy with telegram service, which also does not provide an acknowledgement back to the sender.


In other situations, the convenience of not having to establish a connection to send one short message is desired, but reliability is essential. The acknowledged datagram service can be provided for these applications. It is like sending a regis- tered letter and requesting a return receipt. When the receipt comes back, the send- er is absolutely sure that the letter was delivered to the intended party and not lost along the way.
